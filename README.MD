# Meteora Swap CPI Call

This project implements a Solana-based smart contract using the **Anchor Framework** for calling the **Meteora Swap program** via a Cross-Program Invocation (CPI). It allows users to swap tokens on the **Meteora** decentralized exchange, with support for interacting with the **Meteora Program** and executing token swaps.

This project utilizes Solana's native smart contract architecture, the **Anchor Framework**, and **Solana Program Library (SPL)** tokens for seamless, secure, and efficient token swaps.

## Project Overview

The **Meteora Swap CPI Call** project is a Solana-based decentralized application (dApp) designed to interact with the **Meteora Program**, enabling users to swap two tokens using the cross-program invocation pattern.

### Key Features:
- **Token Swap:** Allows users to swap tokens on the Meteora decentralized exchange (DEX).
- **Meteora Program Integration:** Interacts with the Meteora Program for liquidity pool management.
- **Cross-Program Invocation (CPI):** Utilizes Solana's CPI for secure and efficient program interaction.
- **Vault Authority:** Provides a vault for managing token reserves and swap operations.
- **Token Reserve Management:** The contract supports managing token reserves for liquidity pools.

---

## Features

- **Swap Tokens:** Users can swap tokens between two different pools (reserve_x and reserve_y).
- **User Token In/Out:** Users can provide one token as input and receive another as output.
- **CPI with Meteora:** The contract calls the Meteora Program via CPI to execute token swaps.
- **Mint Tokens:** The contract supports interacting with tokens like SPL tokens.
- **Rewards Mechanism:** Based on the amount swapped and the reserve pools.
- **Event Authority:** Tracks events and token swap transactions.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Solana Blockchain**: The contract is deployed on the Solana blockchain.
- **Rust & Anchor Framework**: Written using the Anchor framework for Solana smart contracts.
- **Solana Program Library (SPL)**: Utilizes SPL tokens for handling token transactions.
- **Metaplex**: Optionally, you can integrate this with Metaplex NFTs for additional functionality.

## Smart Contract

The **Meteora Swap CPI Call** smart contract allows users to swap tokens via the **Meteora Program** using a CPI. The contract interacts with various accounts such as reserves, token mints, and the userâ€™s token balances. The logic is implemented in the **Rust programming language** using the **Anchor framework**.

### Key Components:
- **`token_swap` Function**: The main function that performs the token swap by invoking the Meteora Program.
- **`get_ix_data` Function**: Serializes the instruction data to be sent to the Meteora Program.
- **Vault and Reserve Management**: Includes vault authority management and reserve tokens handling.

## How to Set Up

### Prerequisites:
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/): The Rust programming language for compiling the smart contract.
- [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools): The Solana command-line interface.
- [Anchor Framework](https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/getting-started/introduction.html): The framework for developing Solana smart contracts.
- [Phantom Wallet](https://phantom.app/): Solana wallet to interact with the dApp.

### Step-by-Step Setup:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Immutal0/meteora-swap-cpi-call.git
   cd meteora-swap-cpi-call
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure that you have **Rust** and **Anchor** installed. Install them if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

   Install **Anchor**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @project-serum/anchor-cli
   ```

3. **Build the Contract**:
   Inside the project directory, run the following to build the contract:
   ```bash
   anchor build
   ```

4. **Deploy to Devnet**:
   First, make sure to set your Solana CLI to devnet:
   ```bash
   solana config set --url devnet
   solana airdrop 2
   ```

   Deploy the contract using Anchor:
   ```bash
   anchor deploy
   ```

5. **Configure the Meteora Program Key**:
   The **Meteora Program Key** is hardcoded as:
   ```rust
   pub const METEORA_PROGRAM_KEY: &str = "LBUZKhRxPF3XUpBCjp4YzTKgLccjZhTSDM9YuVaPwxo";
   ```
   You can replace this key with the actual deployed program key of the Meteora DEX if needed.

## How to Use

1. **Interact with the dApp:**
   - Deploy the contract on Solana's devnet.
   - Use the frontend to connect your wallet (e.g., Phantom).
   - Stake/Swap tokens by providing input and output tokens.
   
2. **Perform a Token Swap:**
   - Select the tokens you wish to swap (e.g., Token X and Token Y).
   - Specify the amount of tokens to swap and the minimum amount of output tokens.
   - Execute the swap through the contract.

3. **Vault and Reserve:**
   - Ensure you have sufficient reserves (Token X and Token Y) for the swap to occur.

4. **Check Transactions and Events:**
   - Transaction details and events are logged for monitoring swaps and liquidity operations.
